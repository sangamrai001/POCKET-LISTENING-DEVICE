# Pocket Listening Device

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to design a pocket listening device capable of picking up very faint or remote sounds and amplifying them. The device should maintain a constant output level, ensuring that faint sounds are amplified while strong signals are attenuated to a safe level.

## Features and Applications
- **Condenser Microphone Integration**: The device is equipped with a condenser microphone to capture audio signals present in the environment effectively.
  
- **Output Connectivity**: A female audio jack is connected at the output, allowing users to listen to the amplified sounds through earphones.

- **Potential Applications**:
  - **Spy Device**: This product can be implemented as a spy device, capable of picking up sounds with very low amplitudes.
  - **Hearing Aid**: It can also serve as a hearing aid for individuals who are partially deaf, helping them to perceive sounds that they might otherwise miss.

## Conclusion
The Pocket Listening Device presents innovative solutions for sound amplification in various applications, enhancing both utility and accessibility for users.
