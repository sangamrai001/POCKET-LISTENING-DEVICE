# POCKET-LISTENING-DEVICE
A pocket listening device that can pick up very faint or remote sounds and amplify them. It should be designed to maintain a constant level at the output, i.e., the faint sounds should be amplified, and the strong signals should be attenuated to a certain level considered safe.
